Build and Deploy custom ChatGPT AI App in JavaScript | OpenAI, Machine Learning

CodeLab Chat, a customized version of the ChatGPT3 app, is an AI-based web application with a beautiful user interface that is similar to the ChatGPT app. 
It has excellent communication with the advanced GPT3 model API, but most importantly, 
it allows users to ask the AI for assistance with JavaScript, React, or any other programming language, 
provide it with code and have it translate it to another programming language, among other things.
